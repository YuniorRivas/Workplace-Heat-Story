        <h1>What Lies Ahead for Latino Workers? Extreme Heat, Empty Promises and Political Uncertainty</h1>

        <h2>As heat-related deaths rise in the U.S., Latino workers face deadly conditions without sufficient protections.</h2>

        <p><strong>By Yunior Rivas Garcia</strong></p>

        <p><strong>NEW YORK</strong> - On a sweltering summer day in 2023, Esvin Cruz Mateo stumbled as he unloaded heavy boxes from a truck at a warehouse in Bushwick, New York. The heat was oppressive, and as the day dragged on, his breathing quickened, his movements became clumsier, and his vision blurred. When his coworkers saw him collapse, they rushed to his side. </p>

        <p>But there was nothing they could do.</p>

        <blockquote>
            “We could tell something was wrong when he stopped moving, but within minutes, he was gone,” said Bladimir Najera, a former coworker of Esvin. “We tried to help him, but it was too late.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>Cruz Mateo was just 24 years old and had arrived in the U.S. from Guatemala less than a year earlier.</p>

        <p>With no close relatives in the country, he was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://www.osha.gov/ords/imis/accidentsearch.accident_detail?id=158573.015">investigations</a> by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the federal agency responsible for workplace safety, Esvin died of multi-organ failure, with extreme heat exposure and carbon monoxide from truck fumes cited as contributing factors. His body was sent back to Guatemala, where it was received by his mother, Paulina Mateo, and the people of their hometown, Jalapa.</p>

        <blockquote>
            “They sent him back in a box. I never got to say goodbye to him, never got to see him one last time,” said Paulina Mateo, tears streaming down her face as she recalled the moment she received the news. “All I want to know is why they let this happen. Why didn’t they protect him?”
        </blockquote>

        <p>The investigation into her son’s death remains “open.”</p>

        <p>Latino workers in the U.S., like Cruz Mateo, face a growing risk of <a href=https://www.americanprogress.org/article/extreme-heat-is-more-dangerous-for-workers-every-year/#:~:text=As%20with%20other%20occupational%20hazards,48>heat stress</a>, especially in essential sectors like construction, agriculture, and warehousing. While Latinos make up only 17% of the U.S. workforce, they have accounted for one-third of all workplace heat-related deaths since 2010, according to data from the <a href=https://www.bls.gov/cps/demographics.htm>Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> (BLS). Yet labor protections remain inadequate.</p>

        <p>The latest <a href=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cfoi.pdf>Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries</a> (published in 2024) revealed that Latino workers represented 24%, nearly one-quarter, of all workplace fatalities, with construction and material transportation ranking among the deadliest occupations. These industries regularly expose workers to extreme heat, and many of these workers are undocumented, limiting their ability to demand better workplace protections.</p>

        <p>Heat-related fatalities rose by 19.4% between 2021 and 2022 alone.</p>

        <br></br>
        <p>According to <a href=https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/07272023>OSHA</a>, the annual average of heat-related deaths has been 38 over the past decade, but the frequency of extreme weather events has driven this number up in recent years.</p>

        <p>This issue is not limited to the warmest parts of the country. An analysis by <a href=https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/rising-heat-risks-for-workers>Climate Central</a>, a nonprofit organization studying the impacts of climate change, found that the number of days with dangerous heat indices (above 80°F) has increased in nearly 90% of major U.S. cities since 1979. These conditions are also affecting industries like transportation, manufacturing, and services, where working conditions can be equally hazardous.</p>

The employee was exposed to the hazard of high heat from direct sun and radiant heat during the performance of his job duties, including loading his vehicle with packages, sorting packages, retrieving items, lifting packages up to 50 pounds or more, collecting signatures if needed, upkeeping of the vehicle, and driving to multiple locations.  The packages were varied in size, weight, and quantity, which contributed to the physical demand put on the driver to lift and deliver packages in a productive manner.  The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory that included the worksite in Austin, TX, on the day of the incident. 9 Line Transport Inc. is a third party contractor that assists in conducting deliveries for Amazon's distribution warehouse.  Employees routinely work outdoors in excessive heat conditions. The hazard associated is working in excessive heat conditions when performing multiple deliveries, while not having access to a cool down area.  The employees deliver packages varying in size, weight, and quantity to various locations, while being exposed to the heat inside the vehicle and heat produced when stuck in traffic.  The employees do not have air conditioning in all the vehicles, and while making deliveries spend several minutes looking through their cargo to find the packages that need to be delivered.  Working in a metal shell truck increases the outside temperature about 10 degrees per every 5 minutes sitting in the sun.  Employees have limited means to regulate their body's temperature due to the physical demand of delivering multiple packages at a rapid pace; then, getting into a hot vehicle, it is difficult to dissipate their own metabolic heat.  The detective reported that the temperature inside of the truck was 105 degrees and it did not have A/C. The employee died of cardiac arrest with heat-related illness playing a factor.<br>     <b>Occupation:</b> Truck drivers, light<br>     <b>Age:</b> 46 years<br>     <b>Sex:</b> M<br>     <b>Injury:</b> Fatality<br>     <b>NAICS:</b> 492110/Couriers     </div>`)[0];

The employer ran downstairs to check on Employee #1 and discovered that he was laying on the ground, and civilians from a nearby condominium were administering CPR on the employee.  They thought he had tripped, but when they watched him attempt to stand himself back up, and then collapse again, they called 911 and immediately ran to his aid across the lawn.

The employee was standing at the manhole monitoring the person inside the manhole sandblasting the walls of the sewage drainage system, when the Supervisor observed the employee's leg buckle.  He approached the employee and asked if he was ok; the employee stated that his leg was hurting.  The Supervisor sat him on the flatbed of the truck and told him to hold on while he got a replacement so he could sit inside the vehicle; the supervisor went about 100 yards to get the coworker to cover for the employee.  While walking back, the Supervisor noticed that the employee had laid back on the flatbed, so he started running towards the employee.  When the Supervisor got to him, the employee was not responsive; he sat him up and tried to wake him up.  At this time, the Supervisor started putting wet cooling rags on the employee's head and shoulders, and the Supervisor assisted the employee to get out of the manhole.  The employee was not waking up but was breathing.  The coworkers put the employee in the truck. The Supervisor decided to take the employee to the nearest emergency room, seeing that their work location would be difficult for Emergency Medical Services to find.  While driving off the work site, the Supervisor called the office and informed the General Manager (Rocky Davila) about the incident.  The Supervisor and three coworkers arrived at the emergency room about 5:30 p.m. and they took the employee back to evaluate him.

At 1:16 p.m. on July 22, 2020, DOSH was notified. Around 7:00 a.m., the employee and coworkers got ready for their hike, packing their packs and gear. They carried with them a 64 oz. canteen filled with water and two 16 oz. water bottles. Between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., the employee, coworkers, and wildland cadre gathered together and commenced the hike. The hike was paced, with the wildland cadre stopping periodically to provide terrain instruction to the employee and coworkers (teaching them techniques to cut a line, choke flames, etc). The employee stated feeling well throughout the hike, at no point did he feel any signs or symptoms of heat illness. Then, the incident happened right before reaching the last incline of the hike, shortly after the entire group had rested. After resting for a few minutes, the employee and coworkers began the last stretch. A few yards out of the rest area, the employee began to feel cramps and stopped. The employee took out a packet of Drip Drop (an electrolytic powder), to mix with their water. The employee took off his gear pack, and was attended immediately by the cadre. The employee was taken to the ambulance that was onsite and transported to the hospital, where he was admitted and treated.<br>     <b>Occupation:</b> Firefighting occupations<br>     <b>Age:</b> 33 years<br>     <b>Sex:</b> M<br>     <b>Injury:</b> Hospitalized injury<br>     <b>NAICS:</b> 922160/Fire Protection     </div>`)[0];

The employee worked outside from around 7:15 a.m. until 4:15 p.m. During the day, he took approximately three 10- to 15-minute breaks and a 30-minute lunch break. He spent most of his day riding on the back of a truck. At about 10:00 a.m., he complained to his driver of overheating. He continued to work for an additional six hours. The driver did not notify anyone of the new employee's symptoms. At the end of his shift, he began exhibiting symptoms of heat-related illness. He complained of cramps and nausea. He also vomited several times and was unable to retain fluids. The employee returned to the office and described his symptoms to a member of management. By now, these symptoms included cramps in his arms and nausea. Sometime after 6:00 p.m., the employee was driven to De Paul Hospital after suffering multiple episodes of vomiting. He was diagnosed with hyponatremia and heat exhaustion. The employee was admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital. He died on July 12, 2020.

He had been hired on and had completed new worker orientation on July 1, 2020. The facility had seven oven lines. The workers wore hairnets and cloth smocks, provided by the company, over street clothes. The employee was working on oven line number 7, the "Wawa line", in the production/baking department. He loaded dough onto a conveyor belt and unloaded boards from the conveyor. The conveyor belt fed product into an oven that operated at temperatures ranging from 288 degrees C (550 degrees F) to 302 degrees Celsius (575 degrees F). On July 3, the oven was operating at 288 degrees C (550 degrees F). The National Weather Center recorded the high temperature for the day at 2:27 p.m. The highest relative humidity reading was 79 percent, at 11:00 a.m. The line operator noticed the employee walking back and forth from the oven line to the bathroom, acting erratically, and sweating. The line operator sent the employee for an additional break to cool off and hydrate. When the employee returned, he was still behaving erratically, disoriented, and sweating profusely. The line operator notified someone in management, who enlisted the help of the manager of line oven 7 to find and assist the employee. The employee had left the building through a breakroom. The two supervisors found the employee passed out in the parking lot. He was wearing two cloth smocks. The supervisors began removing his clothing to cool him down and called for emergency medical services immediately. The employee was non-responsive when EMTs or paramedics arrived. His temperature was 40.6 degrees C (105 degrees F). He was taken to the Emergency Department at Cooper Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. He had died due to heat-related illness. The medical examiner confirmed that it was a heat-related death. There was no training for the heat.

The employee was working with a crew conducting fire suppression at the site and overhaul activities back at the station. The fire crew consisted of a Coworker #1 (fire captain), Coworker #2 (fire engineer) and the employee. At the site, Coworker #2 manned the pump while the employee and Coworker #1 took a turn handling the high-pressure water nozzle. The crew was spraying at the fire burning the grass, debris and an outbuilding. Due to a radiant heat and strenuous physical exertion, the employee felt nauseated towards the end. The crew was able to contain the fire by approximately 4:13 p.m. The team returned to the fire station and prepped their equipment for the next service call. The firefighter felt worse with symptoms including dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, inability to keep drinking fluid down and diarrhea. He advised Coworker #1 about his symptoms and said he would feel better if he could go home. Coworker #1 allowed the employee to go home. While at home, the employee attempted to rehydrate himself but was still unable to hold anything down and he vomited. His spouse drove him to the hospital later that night where he was admitted. The ambient temperature on the day of the incident was approximately 96 degrees Fahrenheit. The firefighter stated that he had anticipated that he would have to be hydrated to perform work, so he started to hydrate himself at home before starting his shift. When he reported to work the next day, he hydrated himself more with water to Gatorade ratio of 2:1. He also diluted the drip pack in his bottled water to keep himself hydrated. The morning of the grass-fire call, the firefighter hydrated some more and while enroute to the fire zone. The treating physician indicated that the firefighter suffered a hyponatremia and severe heat exhaustion.<br>     <b>Occupation:</b> Firefighting occupations<br>     <b>Age:</b> 29 years<br>     <b>Sex:</b> M<br>     <b>Injury:</b> Hospitalized injury<br>     <b>NAICS:</b> 922160/Fire Protection     </div>`)[0];

He was part of a group of fire fighter trainees on their first week of training. They were at a training site for the county fire department, hiking a trail as part of their training. At 7:00 a.m., they had undergone a physical fitness exam. It consisted of a 1.5-mile (2.4-km) run (in unison), pushups, sit-ups, and pullups. They were instructed more than once to drink water. Each trainee was individually assessed on the number of pushups, sit-ups, and pullups he could perform. Now they were ready for their hike. The recruits were transported to a park about a 50-minute drive away. Up to this point the trainee-employee was feeling perfectly fine. As the trainees hiked, they were closely observed and monitored by the crew leaders, chiefs, and captains. A fire truck with EMTs trailed them in case first aid was required. Throughout the hike the trainees were reminded to partake of the water they carried with them on their packs, to pace themselves, and to stop if needed. The trainees hiked at their own pace; they were not timed. Toward mid-hike, the recruits stopped and reconvened. At this point, the trainee still felt fine, with no indication of heat exhaustion. He continued to drink water at the midpoint stop. He was assessed by the crew leader. About 200 yards (180 meters) out of the rest point, the trainee suddenly felt his legs cramp and give out. The paramedics trailing behind him, his crew members beside him, and his crew leader, who was behind him, came to assist him immediately. They put him in the ambulance truck. He was transported to the hospital. The employee was hospitalized to treat heat exhaustion.<br>     <b>Occupation:</b> Fire Fighter<br>     <b>Age:</b> 23 years<br>     <b>Sex:</b> M<br>     <b>Injury:</b> Hospitalized injury<br>     <b>NAICS:</b> 922160/Fire Protection     </div>`)[0];

During the workday, the employee was constantly making trips to the shade to take a break and drink water. The employee was not feeling any symptoms of heat illness. However, at 3 p.m., the employee asked the foreman how much longer they have in the workday, because he was tired, and his back was hurting.  The foreman said they will finish the end of the field and then go home. Following the question, the employee's legs gave out and he fell on the field. The foreman and a coworker rushed to him and took him to the shade, took off his boots/shirt, gave him water and cooled him down. The foreman then called the office, spoke to personnel there, and the person there asked to speak to the employee. Via phone, the office person asked the employee some questions and passed the phone to the foreman, indicating to the foreman that she would transport the employee to the clinic. The employee then laid in the shade for about 30 more minutes until the office person arrived.  Shortly before she arrived, the employee began shaking (having body tremors) while laying.

It was a hot and humid day, ranging from 92 to 96 degrees, and the employee stated he started to feel hot so he sat on the cart to rest when his vision waned and saw that the grey concrete turned white. The employee attempted to drive the cart back to the yard when he had to stop at the library to cool down. The employee laid down on the ground in the grass under a tree.  When he felt a little better, he headed to the yard again. The employee spoke with his supervisor then went to the breakroom. The employee started to feel nauseated, sick, and very "weak". The employee rested his head down on the table then started throwing up. A coworker observed him throwing up and called the supervisor and 911.

Employee #1 consumed 10-12 (12 oz.) plastic bottles of water and 5-6 (20 oz.) bottles of cold Gatorade while working, and an undetermined amount of pickle juice.  After lunch, the employee felt weak and began experiencing cramps.  The driver and coworker noticed that the employee was struggling to reach for a trash container. At this time, the driver put the employee in the air conditioned cab for about 20-30 minutes, but the employee could not stretch out in the cab of the truck, so he climbed out and laid underneath a shade tree. Employee #1's spasms and cramps became worse and the driver called the supervisor to come to the site.  The supervisor came onsite and called an ambulance for the Employee #1. The heat index at the time the driver called the supervisor to report the employees heat cramps was approximately 102 degrees Fahrenheit.

New Braunfels, San Antonio, TX 78209<br>     <b>Case Status:</b> CLOSED<br>     <b>Summary:</b> At approximately 11:50 a.m. on September 21, 2017, Employee #1 was performing manual activities that included the transport and movement of 25-pound PlaniPatch cement bags (floor prep), 5-gallon buckets of water, and small cleanup tasks on a worksite. He was working within the interior of a building, which was undergoing a new business build-out (new electrical, walls, floors, HVAC, etc.). Coworkers from the electrical contractor and sheetrock/ceiling contractor saw him hauling 25-pound PlaniPatch bags, three bags at a time, via a dolly from the front exterior of the building and traveling about 60 ft to the back interior portion of the building. Employee #1 has been performing this task multiple times during the morning hours. Later on, Employee #1 was found on the ground near the front interior area of the building, face down and unconscious by the electrical contractors who were leaving for lunch. The electrical contractors picked him up and he opened his eyes and seemed to be alert, but was in shock. The electrical contractor noted that his shirt was wet with perspiration. Emergency responders were called for possible heat exposure and the electrical contractors reported that they brought fans and water him while he was alert because they thought his illness may have been due to the heat. Once the paramedics and fire department arrived, Employee #1 lost consciousness again, began foaming at the mouth, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed by the paramedics. Employee #1 was transported to a medical center, where he died at 12:23 p.m. The cause of death was possibly due to heat-related illness. Employee #1 had a history of heart attack, having had one about three years ago. Autopsy findings for him indicated that he had a pre-existing health condition, specifically cardiovascular disease, as well as three-vessel coronary atherosclerosis, cerebrovascular atherosclerosis and cardiomegaly. Pre-existing health conditions can be exacerbated by performing heavy work under extreme heat conditions, leading to severe injury, illness, and death.<br>     <b>Occupation:</b> nan<br>     <b>Age:</b> 61 years<br>     <b>Sex:</b> M<br>     <b>Injury:</b> Fatality<br>     <b>NAICS:</b> 238330/Flooring Contractors     </div>`)[0];

At approximately 11:30 to11:45 a.m., Employee #1 stopped for an approximate 45 to 60 minute lunch break, which he did not return to work on account of heat-related symptoms. Instead, Employee #1 was told to rest in the shade at the jobsite. During this time, Employee #1 exhibited unusual behavior and was eventually observed getting into another employee's truck. Approximately 10 minutes later, two employees went to the truck to get some water (around 1:00 to 1:15 p.m.), where Employee #1 was observed slouched over inside the truck. Employee #1 was unconscious and was driven to the local hospital by the owner. Employee #1 was admitted to the emergency room and died a short time later. Employee #1 suffered heat-related illness (heat stress, heat stroke) and died. The incident investigation reported that the truck windows were down, but this was not effective in cooling Employee #1's core body temperature, which was 107.5 degrees Fahrenheit upon arriving at the emergency room.<br>     <b>Occupation:</b> nan<br>     <b>Age:</b> 41 years<br>     <b>Sex:</b> M<br>     <b>Injury:</b> Fatality<br>     <b>NAICS:</b> 238110/Poured Concrete Foundation and Structure Contractors     </div>`)[0];

The employee and coworkers were engaged in physical training. The employee was using fire protection gear consisting of a coat and pants (turn out), boots, self-contained breathing apparatus (without mask), gloves, Nomex hood, and hat. The gear weighed approximately 35 lbs. The employee was also using fire hoses and various training props. The employee along with other new hires and their mentors were going through evolutions to simulate firefighting work. The employee, finished the first round of a training circuit (the evolution was approximately 15 minutes) and did exceptionally well during the physical fitness evolution according to the report. The training group briefly discussed their activities and went on the second round of the same evolution but with a second mentor. The employee described this mentor as more active and in better physical shape than the first mentor. The employee felt they were doing a lot more than the first round. The second mentor made the employee do extra physical exertion and pushed the employee to do more. The activities were much more strenuous than the first round. About 15 minutes into the second round, the employee felt tired and exhausted but tried to finish the exercises. The employee was ridiculed and suggested to go to Orange County since their training is easier. The employee experienced altered mental state/confusion and became unable to answer questions. The following factors contributed to the accident. Access to drinking water was located approximately 150 feet away from the last station. Employees were required to bring their own water that day. Employees were instructed to ask for water when needed. A water break was not given between evolutions. They were not instructed or encouraged to take cool-down rests, including opening their coats, if they felt the need to do so which would prevent overheating.  The employee sustained heat-related illness. The employee was transported to Riverside Community Hospital and was hospitalized for over two days.<br>     <b>Occupation:</b> Occupation Not Listed<br>     <b>Age:</b> 41 years<br>     <b>Sex:</b> M<br>     <b>Injury:</b> Hospitalized injury<br>     <b>NAICS:</b> 922160/Fire Protection     </div>`)[0];

The coworker offered Employee #1 some water but he did not drink much. The ambulance arrived in about 15 minutes and took the employee to a local hospital. Around 2:30 p.m. he started to feel ill.

His medical evaluation was very consistent with a diagnosis of heat exhaustion, complicated by early kidney failure and Rhabdomyolysis.

Employee #1 had been working since 9:00 a.m.  Throughout the day, he and Coworker #1 had been moving 30-foot-long Number 5 rebar, each weighing approximately 30 pounds, plus other materials.  They had been placing the rebar in trenches and then tying them. Just prior to the incident, Employee #1 and Coworker #1 had each moved 30 rebar, six bars per load, and placed them in a trench.  As they began tying the bars, Coworker #1 saw that Employee #1 was slouched over, able to respond verbally but unable to move.

They administered first aid by applying cool water to his torso and called emergency services.  Emergency services arrived and transported Employee #1 to the hospital.  He was admitted and treated for heat stroke and renal (kidney) failure.

He was at a firing range, participating in a physical training test for a position on the Vermont State Police tactical service unit (VSP TSU). He was one of six candidates participating in an evaluation for one of two positions available on the VSP TSU. The evaluation was carried out in three stages. The candidates completed each stage separately. The stages were interview, physical training course, and firing range. The trooper had completed the interview portion of the process. He began the physical training course evaluation at 1:24 p.m. on September 17, 2015. The course consisted of 10 burpees, 50 pushups, and a 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) run. Next, he would put a gas mask on and pick up a ram. Then he would perform lunges with the ram for approximately 6.1 meters (20 feet), run with the ram for approximately 37 meters (40 yards), drop the ram, take the gas mask off, and low crawl for approximately 9.1 meters (30 feet). Next, he would pick up a shield, run to 5 staggered cones, and take a knee and cover it with the shield at each cone for approximately 15.2 meters (50 feet). Then he would run with shield for aproximately 91 meters (100 yards). Then he would drop the shield, flip a tractor tire five times, drag the tractor tire for approximately 4.6 meters (15 feet), and run to five staggered cones and prone out at each for approximately 15.2 meters (50 feet). Next, he would drag an officer in body armor for approximately 15.2 meters (50 feet). Then he would climb a sand hill that was approximately 9.1 meters (30 feet) high, descend the hill, put the gas mask back on, and  disassemble and assemble a handgun. The trooper collapsed near the end of the approximately 2.4-kilometer (1.5-mile) course on the next to last portion of the course, while climbing the 9.1-meter (30-foot) sand hill at 1:44 p.m. CPR was given and his clothing was removed. No other cooling was carried out. An AED was attached, but no shocks from it were indicated. CPR was carried out for 75 minutes until an ambulance arrived. The trooper was transported to the UVM medical Center. The employee was pronounced dead at 3:17 p.m. that same day. An autopsy cited the cause of death as exertional heat stroke. The original description mentioned "high environmental temperature," but it didn't provide an actual number.<br>     <b>Occupation:</b> Law Enforcement: Police<br>     <b>Age:</b> 28 years<br>     <b>Sex:</b> M<br>     <b>Injury:</b> Fatality<br>     <b>NAICS:</b> 922120/Police Protection     </div>`)[0];

Employee #1 worked for the manufacturer of the equipment and was tasked with maintenance and technical support to host employer. Employee #1 requested assistance from the host employer with lifting a heavy object and the host employer sent a utility technician to assist him. Employee #1 was working with the utility technician at the machine's maintenance position. Heat Inductor #1 was locked out with a host employer maintenance lock for protection of the equipment only. Heat Inductor #1 was in the maintenance position, which was all the way back to the end of the track.  Heat inductor #2 was taken offline by the operator. The operator was located in the operator's pulpit and could not see Employee #1 or the utility technician. Each heat inductor cabinet was approximately 157 inches long by 35 inches wide by 90 inches tall. The actual inductor hooked to the cabinet and extended another 10 to 12 feet. Each cabinet had 4 side hinged doors, running down both sides, for a total of 8 doors on the cabinet.  The inductors had 3 standard positions: in line for operation; resting or offline position; and maintenance position. Each inductor ran on metal tracks that extended approximately 40 feet to accommodate the 3 positions of the inductors. Both heat inductors were driven at 50 HP when moving on the tracks. As Heat Inductor #2 moved to the resting position, Employee #1 became caught between Heat Inductors #1 and #2. Employee #1 was positioned to the inside of Heat Inductor #1, between inductors #1 and #2. The utility technician was on the outside, not around any other moving inductors or moving equipment.

        <blockquote>
        “When the body can’t release enough heat, it starts to fail internally. Organs aren’t designed to withstand elevated internal temperatures for extended periods,” said Dr. Thomas Bernard, a professor at the University of South Florida College of Public Health and an expert in heat stress.
        He emphasized that heat-related deaths are entirely preventable if employers take basic measures. “We’re not talking about expensive technologies or impossible interventions. We’re talking about access to water, regular breaks, and shade."</blockquote>

        <p>While Bernard underscores the unnecessary risks workers face, he also urges workers to practice “self-awareness” and “self-protection.” Workers need to recognize the early signs of heat stress and listen to their bodies. If they feel exhaustion or dizziness, it’s crucial to take a break and hydrate before the situation worsens.</p>

        <p>Though that’s often easier said than done.</p>

        <p>In recent years, several state and institutional efforts have been made to address workplace heat stress risks. In August 2024, New York State issued <a href=https://dol.ny.gov/extreme-weather-guidance>guidelines for employers</a>, highlighting the importance of preventative measures such as emergency response plans and records of heat-related incidents.</p>

        <p>Although not specifically climate-focused, New York also passed “<a href=https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-legislation-establishing-carlos-law>Carlos’ Law</a>” in 2023, increasing penalties for negligent contractors whose lack of safety measures leads to serious injuries or worker deaths. The law, named after a 22-year-old Latino construction worker who died on the job, marks a step toward greater accountability in workplace safety.</p>

        <p>Other states, such as <a href=https://www.osha.gov/heat-exposure/standards>California and Colorado</a>, have implemented specific heat stress regulations to protect workers.</p>

        <p>However, these efforts remain a patchwork of policies that vary from state to state and lack strict enforcement. As of 2024, <a href=https://www.ishn.com/articles/114425-maryland-becomes-sixth-state-to-enact-heat-safety-protections-for-workers#:~:text=Maryland%20joins%20five%20states%20%E2%80%93%20California%2C%20Colorado%2C,already%20have%20statewide%20heat%20standards%20in%20place.>only six</a> states have specific heat protection standards, while others, like <a href=https://elpasomatters.org/2024/07/04/heat-water-breaks-texas-construction-hb2127-death-star/>Texas</a> and <a href=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/04/15/florida-removes-heat-protections-texas/73335597007/>Florida</a>, two states with some of the highest numbers of workplace heat-related deaths, have actively blocked local measures designed to protect workers from extreme heat.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Experts and labor rights advocates warn that without federal regulations or stricter enforcement, workers remain at risk of deadly conditions.</p>

        <blockquote>“These deaths are not accidents; they are the direct result of policies that prioritize profit over human lives,” said Pablo Alvarado, co-director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), a California-based nonprofit advocating for the rights of day laborers, many of whom are Latino and/or immigrants.</blockquote>

        <p>Alvarado does not hide his frustration with what he calls the “systematic neglect” of the most vulnerable workers.</p>

        <blockquote>“We’ve seen progress in places like California, where heat protections have saved lives,” Alvarado said. “These standards show it’s possible to ensure safer working conditions, even in demanding industries like agriculture or construction. But we can’t stop there.”</blockquote>

        <p>As of 2024, OSHA lacks a federal standard for heat stress. Its only tool is the "<a href=https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/2001-10-17-0#:~:text=Although%20OSHA%20does%20not%20have,are%20free%20from%20recognized%20hazards>General Duty Clause</a>," which is reactive and can only be applied after an incident, such as a worker injury or death, has occurred.</p>

        <p>Under President Joe Biden’s administration, OSHA implemented some measures to address this issue, including the creation of a <a href=https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/directives/CPL_03-00-024.pdf>National Emphasis Program</a> (NEP) on heat in 2022, targeting high-risk industries and allowing for preventive inspections during extreme heat advisories. The administration also proposed regulations requiring employers to provide measures like water and cooling areas to protect workers from extreme heat.</p>

        <p>These protections were designed to safeguard approximately <a href=https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/20240830>36 million workers</a> from heat-related health risks, particularly in sectors with physically demanding jobs and consistently high temperatures. However, the proposed regulations have yet to be approved and remain subject to the slow and politically vulnerable federal administrative process.</p>

        <p>Indeed, labor safety advocates fear that Donald Trump’s return to the White House could halt or dismantle these efforts entirely. During his previous administration, Trump rolled back <a href=https://www.nelp.org/insights-research/workplace-safety-enforcement-continues-decline-trump-administration/>numerous health and safety regulations</a>, and his Republican allies have criticized OSHA’s proposed heat rules as impractical for outdoor work.</p>

        <p>This rollback could endanger the lives of millions of workers vulnerable to extreme heat conditions, particularly in states lacking robust local protections.</p>

        <blockquote>
        “We’ve already lived through the erosion of labor protections under his previous administration,” warned Jordan Barad, a former OSHA deputy director and workplace safety expert. “We’ll see more preventable deaths, and Latino and migrant workers will bear the brunt of that suffering.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>When asked about the current state of federal regulations and experts' concerns, OSHA issued a statement acknowledging the severity of the problem.</p>

        <blockquote>
            “Protecting workers from extreme heat remains a priority for OSHA,” said agency spokesperson Patrick Malone in a statement. “We are committed to implementing measures that save lives, including proposing a federal standard and raising awareness about heat stress in high-risk industries.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>Still, without concrete legislation and strict enforcement, administrative promises remain just that, promises.</p>

        <blockquote>“[Esvin] came here to work hard and help his family. But in this country, it feels like our lives don’t matter,” said Najera, Esvin’s former coworker. “No one thinks about us until someone dies.”</blockquote>

        <p>Cruz Mateo’s case and the stories of thousands of other workers, whose names we may never know, make it clear that extreme heat is not just a logistical issue, it’s a labor justice issue.</p>

        <p>As politicians continue to debate productivity versus workplace safety, for millions of Latino workers in the United States, time is already running out.</p>
